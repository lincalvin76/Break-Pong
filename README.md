<p>
  To download this game you must first have <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads">python</a> installed
</p>

<p>While installing python there is a checkbox that says Add to PATH, please make sure you do that. If you already installed python but did not add to PATH, you may need to reinstall.</p>
<p>Once you've installed python with path, open up a terminal and type "pip install pygame", this is what will allow you to run pygame.</p>
<p>Afterwards you can install all the files into a folder then run the python file to play the game!</p>
